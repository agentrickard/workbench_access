# Workbench Access

## Contributing

This repository will eventually be moved to Drupal.org

### Issue tracking

Issues on this github repo are intentionally turned off.
While this repository is private issues will be tracked in Palantir's Redmine: https://redmine.palantir.net/projects/p8-workbench
Once the repository is moved to Drupal.org then that issue queue will be used.

### Development Environment

Palantir developers should use this Vagrant environment for developing Workbench modules: https://github.com/palantirnet/workbench-vagrant

### Testing

This module contains Behat tests in the directory /behat-tests and PHPUnit tests in /tests/src/Unit. Those directories contain instructions for writing and running tests.
